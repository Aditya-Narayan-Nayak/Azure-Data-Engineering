## A Quick Introduction to Azure Data Factory (ADF) and You Need to Learn this Now!

#### The Problem of Big Data!
- The problem with Big data, Relational data, Non-relational data, and Other storage systems. This data Doesn't have the proper context for meaning or providing any meaningful insights because it's vast data, so the analyst or data scientist can't use this data and make any decisions on this raw data. Big data requires service that can work the street and personalized processes to refine vast stores of raw data into actionable business

#### Example:- 
- Just imagine a gaming company that collects petabytes of games logs that are produced by the game in the cloud this company wants to analyze these logs to gain insights into customers' preferences or demographics, for example, and usage behavior, it also wants to identify upsell and cross-sell opportunities developed for example new features, drive business grows and to provide a better experience to its customer. After all that they want to gather all this data to monitor and get insights so how they can do this let's see. 

### What is Azure Data Factory?
- Azure Data Factory is a fully managed Serverless cloud-managed solution that builds for big data solutions with hybrid extract transform load (ETL)
 
- So it's a cloud-based ETL platform and data integration service that allows for the creation of data-driven workflows for orchestrating data movement and transformation data at scale. Also Because of the cloud-based solutions, the scalability is high. 

- Using ADF We can create and schedule data-driven workflows that can eat data from disparate data stores we can build complex ETL processes that transform data visually with data flows or by using compute services like Azure HD Insights, Hadoop, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL data 

- Additionally, we can publish our transformation data to a data store such as a SQL data warehouse for the business intelligence applications to consume ultimately through a data factory raw data can be organized into meaningful data stores and data lakes for better business Decisions

#### How Does it Work?
Usually, there is a data source and a Destination 
- The Data source could be Azure SQL/AWS s3 bucket or any data source type variety of data source
- We have destination that could be Azure Storage account /SQL/SQL data warehouse/Data ware house its have Lots of option

Now we have move data from Source to destination
